# Change Log

All notable changes to homebridge-meross will be documented in this file.

This project tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). In practice, this means that the version number will be incremented based on the following:

- `MAJOR` version when a minimum supported version of `homebridge` or `node` is increased to a new major version, or when a breaking change is made to the plugin config
- `MINOR` version when a new device type is added, or when a new feature is added that is backwards-compatible
- `PATCH` version when backwards-compatible bug fixes are implemented

## 10.5.0 (2024-07-13)

### Added

- Support (beta) `MS100F` temperature sensor
- Support (beta) thermostat `MTS960`

### Changed

- Add MSH300HK to IgnoreHKNative in constants.js (#572) (@LWatso99)

## 10.4.1 (2024-07-13)

### Changed

- Fixed for `hap-nodejs` v1.0.0
- Updated dependencies
- Bump `node` recommended versions to v18.20.4 or v20.15.1

## 10.4.0 (2024-03-25)

### Added

- Support `SP425FW`
- Enable Power Strips (#569) (@ZeliardM)
  - Expose multichannel switch/outlet devices as a single HomeKit power strip accessory

### Changed

- Bump `node` supported versions to v18.19.1 or v20.11.1
- Updated dependencies

## 10.3.0 (2023-12-30)

‚ö†Ô∏è Some things of note:

- The recent updates to the plugin are in response to upcoming changes to the Meross API
  - You may have received an email from Meross about this ([#556](https://github.com/bwp91/homebridge-meross/issues/556))
- The plugin will now store your Meross access token (when using cloud/hybrid connection) in the Homebridge storage directory:
  - This allows the plugin to persist your access token between Homebridge restarts
  - The plugin no longer needs to create a login session every time Homebridge starts
  - The plugin should initialise slightly faster when the token is available
  - Users using MFA/2FA on their Meross account will no longer need to update their config every time they restart Homebridge
  - If the stored token has expired, the plugin will attempt once to refresh the token when initialising and store the new one (when MFA/2FA is not enabled on your Meross account)
- If you are using MFA/2FA on your Meross account:
  - You will need to update the plugin config to include the current code from your authenticator app, otherwise the plugin will not be able to log in
  - The code is only valid for 30 seconds, so you will need to update your config and restart Homebridge within this time
  - If your stored access token becomes invalid/expires, you will need to update your config with the current code and restart Homebridge
  - I am unsure right now how long the access token is valid for!

### Added

- persist access token for fewer logins
- config option to show Meross user key in the log when logging in
  - this used to only show when running beta versions of the plugin
  - for some security, this has been made an option in the config rather than always showing it
- auto-redirect http calls for users needing different Meross domain

    - You should consider moving the entries from the 'Devices Settings' section (at the bottom) to the appropriate section above
    - No breaking change has been made, but in a future version of the plugin I would like to remove the general 'Device Settings' section

## 6.2.0 (2021-08-01)

### Added

- **All Devices**
  - Device online/offline status in the Homebridge log
  - Plugin will show a local device as offline in the plugin ui if the polling has failed due to timeout or `EHOSTUNREACH` (unreachable, normally means the device has lost Wi-Fi connection)
- **Diffusers**
  - Switch between 'colour', 'rainbow' and 'temperature' modes using Eve-only characteristics (create scenes in the Eve app that will appear in the Home app)
- **Single-Channel Outlets**
  - Plugin will now poll every minute for power data for devices that offer this feature (plugin will attempt to check automatically)
  - Current wattage and voltage is available to see in the Eve app
  - Plugin will set the HomeKit 'In Use' status to 'Yes' if the outlet is on and the wattage is above a configurable value
    - This can be useful to set up automations in the Eve app based on whether the wattage has risen above or dropped below a certain value

### Changed

- **Configuration**
  - Plugin will disable if neither of username & password nor user key has been configured
  - Device `connection` setting has been removed, plugin will instead check for a configured `deviceUrl` to determine connection mode
- **Light Devices**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è On/Off light switches will now be exposed as a `Switch` accessory type (you can change to show it as a light in the Home app, or a fan for the sake of it!)

### Fixed

- **Multi-Channel Outlets**
  - An issue preventing multichannel devices from updating from polled data when exposed as outlets
  - The Homebridge UI will now show the correct status for sub-accessories of a multichannel device
- **Light Devices**
  - Reinstate 'lost' support for MSL120B
- **Diffusers**
  - Bugfixes for MOD-100

## 6.1.1 (2021-07-29)

### Fixed

### Added

- **Homebridge UI**
  - More information on the devices tab: connection status, IP address, MAC address and hardware & firmware version
- **New Devices**
  - Initial support for the MOD-100 diffuser - only light control at this stage
- **Configuration**
  - Plugin will now check for duplicate device ID entries in the config and ignore them

### Changed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Platform Versions**
  - Recommended node version bumped to v14.17.4
  - Recommended homebridge version bumped to v1.3.4
- **Single Channel Devices**
  - The plugin will try to auto-detect whether 'Toggle' or 'ToggleX' namespace is used

## 6.0.0 (2021-07-28)

### Important Note

- This new release changes the way that locally controlled devices are managed/configured
- It also brings in the functionality of `homebridge-meross-cloud` plugin
- When updating from v5, your HomeKit accessories will most likely be reset (due to config changes)
- It is recommended to use the Homebridge/HOOBS UI to reconfigure your locally controlled devices
- See the full change log below for more details

### Added

- **Cloud Control**
  - Support for cloud devices (bringing the functionality of `homebridge-meross-cloud` into this plugin)
  - Device MQTT connections so any external changes to devices should be reflected in HomeKit in real time
    - This makes cloud polling no longer necessary, so is now disabled by default, you can re-enable this in the plugin settings
- **Local Control**
  - The use of an account key for local device control
    - The key will automatically be obtained if your Meross credentials are present
    - Docs to find this account key are available in the wiki
    - The use of this account key makes the device `messageId`, `sign` and `timestamp` redundant and these options have been removed
    - It is necessary to also configure the serial number (uuid) per the device in the configuration
    - **‚ö†Ô∏è Your local devices will not work with this version unless you configure the account key and serial number (uuid)**
- **New Devices**
  - MSG100 cloud support added
  - MRS100 cloud and local support added
- **Adaptive Lighting**
  - Adaptive Lighting for supported light bulbs
- **Logging**
  - Logging level on a per-accessory basis, which can be helpful when wanting to debug a specific accessory
- **Configuration Validation**
  - More configuration validation, logging if you have entries that are incorrectly configured or unused
- **No Response Label**
  - Promise-based device control, so the plugin should show a device as 'No Response' if controlling an accessory has failed

### Changed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è All switch/outlet devices will be now exposed to HomeKit by default as a `Switch` (both cloud and local devices)
  - A new configuration setting has been added if you prefer for your device to be exposed as an `Outlet`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cloud multi-channel devices will now appear as separate accessories
  - An extra 'All On/Off' accessory will be shown in HomeKit
  - You can use the 'Hide Channels' setting to hide channels you don't use, including the 'All On/Off' accessory
